A mod for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord

This mod will enable players to put down a "homestead" wherever they feel like it.
Their homestead can be built building by building to make into the players own mini-fief.
Each building in a homestead will give it one of three stats; space, productivity, or leisure. They can also generate products in the homestead stash.
Homesteads will generate income/morale based upon productivity/leisure respectively.
